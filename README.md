(i)Input Interface: Users are presented with an interface to input their date of birth.

(ii)Age Calculation: The application calculates the user's age based on the input date of birth and the current date.

(iii)Display: The calculated age is displayed in years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

(iv)Toggle Functionality: Users can toggle between the input interface and the age display interface.

Overall, the project provides a simple and intuitive way for users to track their age and visualize the passage of time since their birth.
